# Print2
Ever wanted a secondary debug console, well now you can!

## Example usage
```python
import print2

# Some code here maybe
print2.print(["Everything will be tryed to be evaluated as a string!])

# Possible use?
print2("Yes, quite possibly")
```
That's basically  it, nothing more really

## How does this magic work?
1. ```import print2```
2. Starts client
3. Starts server
4. Connects
5. Works and sends stuff
6. Hands of to the script!
